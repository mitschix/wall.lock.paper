# Wallpaper Lockscreen Collection

These wallpapers and lockscreens are collected from a number of different places. Most of the wallpapers are from default wallpaper packages of Linux distributions or from other wallpaper repositorys. Some wallpaper as well as the lockscreens are from google pictures search results. Therefore I do not know if there is a copyright on these images. 

If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.

The majority of these wallpapers are nature and landscape photos. The lockscreens are mostly funny and nerdy jokes.
